What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a .git folder which indicates that the directory containing it has
part of its files tracked by the repository. This is necessary because this way
the computer can treat the directory as a Git repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate space that files don't really exist in as
the working directory or the repository. However, it provides flexibility to
operate files between the working directory and the repository by letting us
choose which files to commit.
